    desc:
        '“The Big Short” traders Danny Moses, Vincent Daniel and Porter Collins are focused on one of their top long bets: gold.\n\n“I just don’t think Americans have enough gold in their portfolio,” Collins said on CNBC’s “Fast Money” in an exclusive interview this week.\n\nThe three investors are known for their successful bet against the housing market ahead of the 2008 crisis.\n\nCollins, who is co-founder of Seawolf Capital with Daniel, referred to massive central bank buying around the world and the U.S. budget deficit as reasons to buy gold.\n\n“If you just think about that one dollar in your wallet, tomorrow it’s worth less,” Collins added. “I think that in … one, two, three, five, 10 years, you’re going to make a lot more money in gold than you will in U.S. Treasurys, and I think that’s just not changing.”\n\nGold futures are up about 15% in 2024, but they are off their all-time high of \$2,488.40 hit on July 17.\n\n“Gold … in the past has done extremely well,” Daniel noted.\n\nDaniel and Collins’ firm highlighted gold in their annual note to shareholders this month.\n\n‘Neither of us can tell if we are bearish or bullish right now’\n\nDanny Moses, founder of Moses Ventures, is also bullish on gold. In a special email to “Fast Money” on Monday, Moses wrote he has a “large long” in the Sprott Physical Gold Trust.\n\nThe exchange-traded fund holds gold bars. According to the Sprott website, it is designed to give investors exposure to the yellow metal “without the inconvenience that is typical of a direct investment.”\n\nAs of Friday’s close, the Sprott Physical Gold trust is up more than 16% so far this year.',

    title: 'Why the new spot ether ETFs may ‘be a hit’ despite recent weakness',
    desc:
        'It’s a historic week for the cryptocurrency markets with spot ether exchange-traded funds making their debut.\n\nFranklin Templeton is one of the nine spot ether ETF applicants which got approval Tuesday from the Securities and Exchange commission.\n\nThe firm is behind the Franklin Ethereum ETF (EZET) — now down about 10% since its inception as of Thursday’s close. The losses were sparked by the sell-off in cryptocurrencies.\n\n“We think they’ll be a hit. Whether they’re going to get the same amount of assets is... probably unlikely,” said David Mann, the firm’s head of ETF product and capital markets, told CNBC’s “ETF Edge” on Tuesday. “But it’s still pretty awesome.”\n\nVanEck, a global investment manager, is behind the VanEck Ethereum ETF (ETHV) which also got approval.\n\nCEO Jan Van Eck expects spot ether ETFs will help investors diversify, but he sees a different energy level for spot ether ETFs.\n\n“I don’t think they’re going to be the same, same kind of hit [as spot bitcoin ETFs]” Van Eck said.\n\nHis new fund is also down sharply since Tuesday.\n\nLong-term, Morningstar’s Ben Johnson considers the volumes for spot ether ETFs as normal because they’re roughly proportional to the relative market cap of ether versus bitcoin.\n\n“There’s healthy appetite. There’s healthy volume. There’s healthy demand there,” the research firm’s head of client solutions said.  ”[The ETFs are] opening up access to new markets, new portions of the investment opportunity set for investors and putting that in a package that is cost effective. It’s convenient, and it’s compatible with the way that more investors are building their portfolios these days.”\n\nEther dropped sharply on Thursday. As of the market close, it’s down about 11% for the week. However, ether is still up 38% so far this year.',

        'SHANGHAI — China on Thursday announced its most targeted measures yet for boosting consumption, which has remained lackluster since the Covid-19 pandemic.\n\nAuthorities announced they would allocate 300 billion Chinese yuan (\$41.5 billion) in ultra-long special government bonds to expand an existing trade-in and equipment upgrade policy. The document was jointly published by the National Development and Reform Commission — China’s economic planning agency — and the Ministry of Finance.\n\n“There have never been such specific measures” aimed at consumption, Bank of China’s chief researcher Zong Liang said in a phone interview Thursday, according to a CNBC translation of his Mandarin-language remarks.\n\nHe noted how the new policy links Beijing’s ultra-long bond program — announced in March — with consumption.\n\n“This is a very important measure for implementing the Third Plenum,” Zong said. He was referring to a high-level meeting of Chinese leaders last week that only occurs twice every 10 years, and which typically sets the tone for economic policy.\n\nThe latest Third Plenum concluded with the release of several major guiding documents over the past weekend that reaffirmed Beijing’s long-term interest in bolstering advanced tech. The official communique focused on “deepening reform.” It also said China would work to achieve its full-year national targets, but disappointed many analysts by not indicating major policy changes.',

        'After a yearlong search, Rana Robillard was elated to learn she’d beaten three other bidders for a house in the leafy California suburb of Orinda, just outside of San Francisco.\n\nSo when Robillard, who works at a software startup, received an email in late January from her mortgage broker with directions to wire a \$398,359.58 down payment to a JPMorgan Chase account, she wasted no time sending the money.\n\nAfter all, the email appeared to be a response to one Robillard had sent her broker asking about final steps before the closing, which was rapidly approaching.\n\nBut on Jan. 30, the day after she’d sent the wire, Robillard got what looked like a duplicate request for the down payment, and it dawned on her that she had fallen for a scam — one that would throw her life into turmoil for the next six months. To her horror, instead of sending a down payment for her future home to the title company, as she believed she had done, Robillard had been tricked into sending her life savings to a criminal.\n\n“That’s when I went into a full panic,” Robillard, 55, told CNBC, which verified the details of her story with the four banks involved.\n\nWhat happened to Robillard, a 25-year veteran of tech companies including cybersecurity firm HackerOne, speaks to the increasingly sophisticated nature of cybercrime. Fraudsters are able to penetrate the email systems of mortgage brokers, real estate agents, lawyers or other advisors, waiting for the perfect moment to strike by sending emails or phone calls that appear to be from trusted parties.\n\nReal estate, with its large transaction sizes and frequent use of wire transfers, has proven to be an especially lucrative target for criminals. Wires are faster than other forms of payment, typically closing within 24 hours, can handle far larger sums and are often irreversible, making them ideal for fraud.\n\nScams involving fake emails in real estate deals have exploded over the last decade, rising from less than \$9 million in losses in 2015 to \$446.1 million by 2022, according to FBI data.',

        'NASHVILLE — Former President Donald Trump said that if he were returned to the White House, he would ensure that the federal government never sells off its bitcoin holdings. But he stopped short of proposing a formal federal reserve of digital currency.\n\n“For too long our government has violated the cardinal rule that every bitcoiner knows by heart: Never sell your bitcoin,” Trump said during his keynote speech at this year’s Bitcoin Conference in Nashville, the biggest bitcoin conference of the year.\n\nThe former president’s remarks came as the race to capture the votes and the campaign cash of America’s frontline fintech adopters takes center stage in the 2024 presidential contest.\n\n“This afternoon I’m laying out my plan to ensure that the United States will be the crypto capital of the planet and the bitcoin superpower of the world and we’ll get it done,” Trump said.\n\nBut Trump’s pledge to simply maintain the U.S. government’s current bitcoin holdings was a less radical pitch to the crypto crowd relative to other proposals at the conference.\n\nThird-party candiago Robert F. Kennedy Jr., for instance, during his Friday Bitcoin Conference speech promised to launch a reserve of 4 million bitcoin, starting with the bitcoin holdings that the U.S. government already has stockpiled from criminal seizures. Kennedy said he would manago the government purchase 550 bitcoin a day until the reserve reached 4 million.\n\nShortly after Trump’s speech, Sen. Cynthia Lummis, R-Wy., read out her own legislative proposal to amass an official U.S. federal reserve of 1 million bitcoin over five years.\n\n“It will be held for a minimum of 20 years and can be used for one purpose: Reduce our debt,” Lummis said.\n\nThe price of bitcoin briefly dipped during Trump’s speech, but recovered and was up slightly for the day, as of 5:15 p.m. E.T.\n\nThroughout his remarks, the former president worked to draw contrasts between the Republican Party’s growing embrace of crypto versus the hardline regulatory approach that has characterized the Biden administration.\n\n“The Biden-Harris administration’s repression of crypto and bitcoin is wrong and it’s very bad for our country,” Trump said. “Let me tell you if they win this election, every one of you will be gone. They will be vicious. They will be ruthless. They will do things that you wouldn’t believe.”\n\nTrump went on to list a series of crypto-friendly promises to a crowd of cheering bitcoin supporters, promising to dismantle what he called the “anti-crypto crusade” of President Joe Biden and Vice President Kamala Harris.',

        'When Jay Chaudhry sold his first company for \$70 million, he focused less on his own riches, he says — and more on how the deal could turn dozens of his employees into millionaires.\n\nChaudhry, 65, is known today as the billionaire founder and CEO of Zscaler, a cloud cybersecurity firm valued at roughly \$28 billion, as of Wednesday afternoon. Back in 1998, he was a first-time entrepreneur selling the startup he launched with his wife Jyoti, SecureIT, to VeriSign in an all-stock deal for a huge windfall.\n\nNearly two years after the deal closed, as VeriSign’s stock price soared, more than 70 of SecureIT’s 80 employees “on paper, were millionaires,” Chaudhry tells CNBC Make It.\n\n“People were going crazy in the company, because they had never thought of so much money,” he says. “A lot of them were buying new houses. They were buying new cars. I know one guy, he took six months off, rented a [mobile home] and went around the country. They could do what they wanted to do.”\n\nBetween the time of the acquisition and February 2000, VeriSign’s stock increased by more than 2,300%, closing at a high of \$253 per share, helped by two stock splits and a temporary bubble for tech stocks. The bubble burst later that year, and VeriSign’s stock lost roughly 75% off that high point at the end of 2000, sinking to a low of nearly \$4 in 2002.',

        'Gold jumped to a record Tuesday as rising expectations of a September interest rate cut bolstered demand for bullion.\n\nGold futures settled up 1.6% to an all-time closing high of \$2,467.8 per ounce, after also hitting a new intraday record high of \$2,474.5 during the session. Gold futures prices have climbed more than 19% this year.\n\nSpot gold jumped 1.9% to \$2,468.68 an ounce during the session. LSEG data shows that’s an all-time high going back to 1968, without adjusting for inflation.\n\nGold prices hit record highs earlier this year before pulling back as the prospect of higher-for-longer interest rates dampened investor enthusiasm for the precious metal. But interest in the asset has grown after June’s softer inflation data and some recently dovish comments from Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell combined to raise the odds of rate cuts coming this year. Markets are pricing in 100% odds of a rate cut in September now, according to futures trading tracked by the CME FedWatch tool.\n\nA weakening dollar has also supported demand for bullion. On Tuesday, the U.S. greenback rebounded after falling to a five-week low.\n\n“Interest to ‘buy-the-dip’ remained prevalent among investors amid strong sentiment towards gold, which is likely why the market was quick to rally on soft U.S. data prints and dovish Fed expectations,” UBS strategist Joni Teves said in a note on Friday.\n\n“With the market sitting just above the psychological \$2400 level, we think risks are skewed to the upside,” Teves continued. “We think positioning remains lean and there’s space for investors to build gold exposure.”\n\nGold rallied to record highs in the first half of 2024 on the back of a multiyear spike in demand from central banks around the world, as mounting global geopolitical risks boosted interest in the safe haven asset. According to UBS, central bank buying of bullion is the highest it’s been since the late 1960s.',
